Rep: Thanks for joining, Sarah. Can you tell me about your current challenges?
Sarah: Our sales team has grown from 75 to 150 reps, and our CRM can't keep up.
Rep: What specific pain points are you experiencing?
Sarah: Reps spend 3 hours daily on data entry. We need automation badly.
Rep: What's your budget for a solution?
Sarah: We've allocated $400,000 to $600,000 annually.
Rep: And your timeline?
Sarah: We need implementation before Q3 - within 60 days.
Rep: Perfect. Let me show you how our AI can save 20 hours per rep weekly.

Tech Lead: We need to understand your security posture.
Rep: We're SOC 2 Type II certified with AES-256 encryption.

Rep: Full REST API with webhook support. Most integrations done in a week.
Tech Lead: Can you guarantee US data residency?
Rep: Absolutely. We offer US-only hosting and private cloud deployment.

Decision Maker: We've made our decision - you're our choice.
Rep: Fantastic! What sealed the deal?
Decision Maker: The ROI is compelling - 20 hours saved per rep at $50/hour is $1000 weekly.
Rep: That's exactly right. With 50 reps, you're saving $2.6M annually.
Decision Maker: We need the contract by month end for budget approval.
Rep: I'll send it today. Do you prefer annual or quarterly payments?
Decision Maker: Quarterly works better for our cash flow.
Rep: Perfect. I'll include our implementation timeline - typically 2-3 weeks.
