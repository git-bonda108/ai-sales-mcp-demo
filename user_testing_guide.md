### **STEP 2: Process Discovery Call (10 minutes)**

**Navigate to:** Training Pipeline tab

```
Rep: Hi Jennifer, what's driving your interest in a new sales platform?

Jennifer: We're drowning in manual processes. Our 200 sales reps spend hours updating Salesforce instead of selling.

Rep: How much time per rep daily?

Jennifer: At least 2-3 hours daily. We're looking at 40% revenue growth but can't scale with current tools.

Rep: Timeline for implementation?

Jennifer: We need something before Q4 - within 90 days max.

Rep: Budget range?

Jennifer: For the right solution that saves 2 hours per rep daily, we'd invest $800,000 to $1.2M annually.

Rep: That's $10.4M in annual productivity gains. Can we schedule a technical demo?

Jennifer: Absolutely. Send me a calendar invite.
```
